# NodeJS and Databasing: Basics of IBM Cloudant Workshop

In this Worshop you will learn the basics of IBM Cloudant and how to create a NodeJS application that is powered by Cloudant NoSQL DB.

At the end of the workshop, participants will have learned the "Needs-to-Know" about Cloudant NoSQL DB and will have deployed a NodeJS and ReactJs application to the cloud driven by data housed in IBM Cloudant.

This game was created by myself and [Kyle Smith](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-smith-67393b80/)

Amber uses Cloudant NoSQLDB to gain insights on how players play our game and how to make the game better. All information is completely anonymized and has **ZERO** personal information associated to it.

Here is an example of the data stored in our Cloudant NoSQL DB:
